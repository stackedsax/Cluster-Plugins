msgid "One common mistake is to insert the images into the post using the content editor. This is not necessary – the plugin detects all images attached to the post and creates the slideshow automatically."

msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "A: If the images show up fine in the \"Add Slides\" metabox in your admin, but don't on the front-end, this could be a theme conflict. Your best option is to inspect the page with a browser console open, and/or to set <code>WP_DEBUG</code> to <code>true</code> in your site's <code>wp-config.php</code> file to see if any PHP errors show up on your site."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "If you can see the first slide of the slideshow, but clicking doesn't do anything, this is almost always a JavaScript conflict from your theme (or another plugin). It could caused by a jQuery library conflict. View the HTML source of the page which is supposed to show the slideshow. Do you see more than one copy of jQuery or the Cycle plugin being loaded? If your theme or other plugins load those same files directly, you will have a conflict. Your best option here is to manually dequeue conflicting scripts. Check out <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_dequeue_script\">the <code>wp_dequeue_script()</code> function</a> for more information on doing so."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "If you don't see the jQuery Cycle plugin or Portfoliio Slideshow JavaScript and CSS files being loaded on posts and pages with the <code>[portfolio_slideshow]</code>, then 99 times out of 100 this means that your theme is not using the required WordPress theme functions <code>wp_head()</code> and/or <code>wp_footer()</code>. These functions are <em>required</em> for almost all plugins to work correctly, not just Portfolio Slideshow. Please consider using a different theme, or at least contact the theme developer about these missing functions."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "A: By default, the slideshow uses the large-size images that are generated by WordPress when you upload an image. You can change this default in the settings panel for the plugin, or on a per-page basis using the size attribute (see installation instructions for usage)."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "If you would like to change the size of the images system-wide (for example, you want a large image to be 800px instead of 1025px) you can change the WordPress settings in the \"Settings -&gt; Media\" control panel. You will need to regenerate your thumbnails to make the setting retroactive. If you're in this situation, I cannot recommend the aptly named Regenerate Thumbnails plugin enough! <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/\">Download it here</a>. I have used that on sites with thousands and thousands of large images, and it works very well."
